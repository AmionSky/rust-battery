Rust crate providing cross-platform information about batteries.

Gives access to a system independent battery state, capacity, charge and voltage values
recalculated as necessary to be returned in `mW`, `mWh` or `mV` units.

## Supported platforms

* Linux 2.6.39+
* MacOS (10.10+ probably, needs to be confirmed)
* Windows 7+

# API stability

Until `1.0.0` version API might change in any moment, be careful.

## Example

This crate acts both as library and as binary executable, so you can install and check it:

1. Install `battery` crate:

```bash
$ cargo install battery
```

2. Call the installed file:

```bash
$ ~/.cargo/bin/battery
Device:                 0
vendor:                 DP
model:                  bq20z451
S/N:                    N/A
battery
  state:                discharging
  energy:               27.50 Wh
  energy-full:          33.75 Wh
  energy-full-design:   50.05 Wh
  energy-rate:          13.94 W
  voltage:              7.83 V
  time-to-empty         1h 58m 18s
  percentage:           55.00%
  temperature:          29.70 Â°C
  capacity:             67.43%
  cycle-count:          692
  technology:           lithium-ion
```

I guess I'll need to replace my battery soon ðŸ˜©
